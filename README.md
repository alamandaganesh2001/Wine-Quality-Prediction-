# Wine-Quality-Prediction- 
The Wine Quality Prediction project aims to determine the quality of wines based on specific attributes using linear regression. By training a machine learning model on a dataset comprising various wine characteristics, the model can predict the quality rating of a given wine sample. The Jupyter notebook code offers insights into the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation stages.
